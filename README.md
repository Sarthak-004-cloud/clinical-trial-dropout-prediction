# Clinical Trial Dropout Prediction & Retention Strategy

##  What This Project Is About
In clinical trials, a lot of patients drop out before completion — which delays drug development and increases costs. I built a solution that predicts which patients are most likely to drop out and helps design smarter retention strategies.

##  What I Did
- Used real-world data (AstraZeneca format) to train a machine learning model (XGBoost) to predict patient dropout.
- Applied SHAP to explain what factors contribute most to dropout (like side effects, duration, demographics).
- Built a simple Streamlit dashboard where users can explore predictions and test different retention strategies (e.g., incentives, schedule changes).
